Overview
The script defines a simple calculator function in Python, which allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Detailed Explanation
Function Definition:

python
def calculator():
This line defines a new function called calculator.

Welcome Message:

python
print("Welcome to the calculator!")
print("Select operation")
print("1. Add")
print("2. Subtract")
print("3. Multiply")
print("4. Divide")
These lines print a welcome message and display the available operations to the user.

User Input for Operation:

python
choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4): ")
This line prompts the user to enter their choice of operation and stores the input in the variable choice.

Check Valid Choice:

python
if choice in ['1', '2', '3', '4']:
This line checks if the user’s choice is valid (i.e., one of '1', '2', '3', or '4').

User Input for Numbers:

python
num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
These lines prompt the user to enter two numbers and convert them to floating-point numbers.

Perform Operation:

python
if choice == '1':
    print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
elif choice == '2':
    print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
elif choice == '3':
    print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
elif choice == '4':
    if num2 != 0:
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}")
    else:
        print("Error! Division by zero.")
This block of code checks the user’s choice and performs the corresponding operation:

Addition: If the choice is '1', it adds num1 and num2 and prints the result.

Subtraction: If the choice is '2', it subtracts num2 from num1 and prints the result.

Multiplication: If the choice is '3', it multiplies num1 by num2 and prints the result.

Division: If the choice is '4', it checks if num2 is not zero (to prevent division by zero) before performing the division and printing the result. If num2 is zero, it prints an error message.

Invalid Choice Handling:

python
else:
    print("Invalid input")
This block handles invalid choices by printing an "Invalid input" message if the user entered something other than '1', '2', '3', or '4'.

Call the Function:

python
calculator()
This line calls the calculator function to run the calculator.

Summary
This script is a simple, interactive calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It ensures that the user input is valid and handles division by zero gracefully. The function is user-friendly, providing clear instructions and feedback.
